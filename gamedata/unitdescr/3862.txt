Falconry has always been a popular pastime activity among the noblesse of Marignon, but with the emergence of the devil cult a new form of falconry have developed. Infernal imps are bound and sold to the nobility who use them to hunt anr entertain themselves. Special imp trainers with limited skills in Goetica take the role of faconeers and train the imps. The imps are clever and like to hurt people, and do not require much training to be used in battle, so it is not unusual to see imp trainers joining their lords in war brining their imps with them. The imp trainers are not regular commanders, but their training allow them to command other devils, should the need arrive. The imps can rarely hurt armored soldiers, but they can harass enemy archers and mages.
